# SaaSPhoto-Editor-Project
Summary Project:

The goal of this project is to develop a cloud-based SaaS Photo Editing Application similar to Adobe 
Photoshop but simplified for web usage. The application will allow users to upload images, apply filters, 
add text, and manipulate layers. It will leverage React.js for the frontend and Node.js/Express.js for the 
backend. The project will follow a subscription-based model where users can access basic features for 
free and unlock advanced features with a premium plan.

Key Features:

Upload and edit images on a canvas (Fabric.js)

Apply basic filters (grayscale, brightness and contrast)

Add text and shape overlays

Manage layers (move, resize, delete elements)

Save and export edited images in multiple formats (JPEG, PNG, SVG)

Undo/redo functionality for enhanced editing

User authentication and profile management

Collaboration tools for multi-user editing (real-time synchronization)

Integration with third-party cloud storage providers (Google Drive, Dropbox)

AI
-powered auto-enhancements and background removal

Technology Stack:

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Fabric.js, Redux for state management

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB (for user storage & image history)

Storage: Cloudinary or Firebase for image hosting

Authentication: Firebase Auth / OAuth integration Google

Real
-
Time Collaboration: WebSockets with Socket.io

AI Features: TensorFlow.js for basic AI-powered enhancements
